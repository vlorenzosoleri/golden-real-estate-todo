TODO Tracking app for projects on the Golden Real Estate company

## Assignment Description:

This assignment is to write an application managing a TO-DO list, to track project progress for the buildings of a speculative Company called "Golden Real Estate".

The projects are activities to remember and collaborate on; like fixing some defects, cleaning the facade, renewing the fire extinguishers etc.

We need to see project status per building and per person it is assigned to.

The application should be simple, easy to use and should have a clean and efficient user interface.

 

The application also need to have a home page explaining its features/advantages. This is more of a marketing/presentation skills test. Feel free to unleash your creative ideas.

 

The project has to be developed with the following tools:

Java, Hibernate, Maven, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL and either Apache Wicket, VueJs version 3 or ReactJS for the front end.

You can assume having a PostgreSQL database on the local machine with an empty database "tests" and a user name "sylvain" with no password.

We should be able to launch the application via "mvn jetty:run".
